# IBM-Quantum-Challenge-Solutions
Here I have uploaded my solution to excercise 4 of the IBM Quantum Challenge (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/challenges). After diagonalizing given unitary with hadamard matrix, I designed my circuit from scratch using CZ and Rz gates by matching the phases of each of the basis states. I used transpile to get circuit in terms of required basis gates. 
##### The cost of my circuit was 48 (ranked 57th)
